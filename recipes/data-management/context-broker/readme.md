# Orion

Here you can find recipes aimed at different usages of the Orion Context Broker.
We assume you are already familiar with Orion. If not, refer to the
[official documentation](https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker).

The easiest and simplest way to try Orion is as explained in
[Orion's official docker image docs](https://hub.docker.com/r/fiware/orion/)
using  [this docker-compose](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml)
file. But here, we will explore a distributed configuration for this Generic
Enabler.

If you are new to docker as well you probably want to start looking at the
[simple recipe](./simple/readme.md) to have a first view of how a single-host
simple scenario looks like.

Instructions on how to prepare your environment to test these recipes are given in [https://github.com/smartsdk/smartsdk-recipes](https://github.com/smartsdk/smartsdk-recipes).
