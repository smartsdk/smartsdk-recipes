# Welcome

This site is dedicated to the documentation of the recipes brought by
[SmartSDK](https://www.smartsdk.eu) to launch, test and experiment different
[FIWARE Generic Enablers](https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers) and combinations of them known as common use cases.

Recipes will be based on [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) and maybe some complementary scripts. For simple cases, you may be able to run them on a single Docker host using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). However, the more interesting scenarios are aimed to be run in a [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) cluster.

Recipes are organized in folders respecting the [FIWARE Chapters](https://www.fiware.org/our-vision/) and the [Generic Enablers]((https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers)) they are aimed to work with. Shared functionality can be found in the ```utils``` folder.


## Getting started

Head first to the [Installation](./installation.md) section and follow the instructions to get the code and set-up your environment.

Then, feel free to explore the different recipes and their referenced parts of the corresponding FIWARE documentation.

Don't miss the [Contributing](./contributing.md) section in case you'd like to improve this repo.

Also, you may want to have a look at the [Tools](./tools/readme.md) section, specially if you want to test the recipes in a local environment.
