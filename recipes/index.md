# Welcome

This site is dedicated to the documentation of the recipes brought by
[SmartSDK](https://www.smartsdk.eu) to launch, test and experiment different
[FIWARE Generic Enablers](https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers) and
combinations of them known as common use cases.

Recipes will be based on [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) and maybe some
complementary scripts. For simple cases, you may be able to run them on a single
Docker host using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
However, the more interesting scenarios are aimed to be run in a
[Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) cluster.

Recipes are organized in folders respecting the
[FIWARE Chapters](https://www.fiware.org/our-vision/) and
the [Generic Enablers](https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers) they are aimed
to work with. Shared functionality can be found in the `utils` folder.

Also, you may want to have a look at the [Tools](./tools/readme.md) section,
specially if you want to test the recipes in a local environment.

## Getting started

Head first to the [Installation](./installation.md) section and follow
the instructions to get the code and set-up your environment.

Then, feel free to explore the different recipes and their referenced parts
of the corresponding FIWARE documentation. Note that the structure of this
documentation is mapped to the structure of the repository recipes folders to
make your navigation easier.

Don't miss the [Contributing](./contributing.md) section in case you'd like
to improve this repo.
